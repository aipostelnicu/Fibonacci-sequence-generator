# Fibonacci-sequence-generator

According to the chalenge request, I was asked to create a function which will return an array of fibonacci sequence elements, the array length should be equal with the function argument input number. Because for the first two numbers of the sequence we cannot apply a rule, I showed them with an if statement and the rest of the sequence can be calculated applying a rule which consist of addition of the previous element with the element before that. I helped myself using this page: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html
